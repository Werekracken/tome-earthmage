This addon for [Tales of Maj'Eyal](https://te4.org/) adds the Earth Mage as a mage class that combines earth magics with wild gifts. Earth Mages have learned the basics of how to create and use alchemist gems, but developed their own specialized uses as well.

Mana and equilibrium are their resources and their most important stat is Magic followed by Willpower and Constitution. They use some existing talent trees from Archmage and Stone Warden, and have a new class tree: Spell / Lapidary. Their playstyle is multitarget, area of effect, and damage over time, with a lot of options for survivability.
